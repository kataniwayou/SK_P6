/// KEEP-04 (D-04): on the SAME edges, this loop also drives the keeper-recovery receive endpoint's
/// <c>Stop</c>/<c>Start</c> through the Plan-02 <see cref="RecoveryEndpointHandle"/> singleton — the unhealthy
/// edge <c>Stop</c>s consumption (messages accumulate non-destructively on the broker; gate-closed never
/// dequeue-and-drops) and the healthy edge <c>Start</c>s it (drain). The endpoint Stop/Start is ADDITIVE to the
/// existing gate.Open/Close + PauseAll/ResumeAll signalling on these edges (gate.Open/Close are still read by
/// the recovery consumers / tests and are NOT removed). All edge actions live inside the one WR-01 try, so a
/// Stop/Start throw leaves prevHealthy un-advanced and the next tick re-applies the (idempotent) edge.
