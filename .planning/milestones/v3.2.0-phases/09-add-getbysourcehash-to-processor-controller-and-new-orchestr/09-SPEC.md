# Phase 9: Processor.GetBySourceHash + Orchestration Start/Stop — Specification

**Created:** 2026-05-28
**Ambiguity score:** 0.11 (gate: ≤ 0.20)
**Requirements:** 6 locked

## Goal

Add one new endpoint to `ProcessorsController` (`GetBySourceHash`) and one new `OrchestrationController` with two endpoints (`StartOrchestration`, `StopOrchestration`). `GetBySourceHash` follows the existing `BaseController.GetById` response semantics (200 + ProcessorReadDto on hit, 404 on miss via `NotFoundException`). The Orchestration endpoints accept `List<Guid> WorkflowIds` and, for v1, **only validate the list** (duplicates + non-empty + non-`Guid.Empty` + existence of every Workflow id) — on success they return **204 No Content** with no body and no orchestration side-effects.

> **Amended 2026-05-28 (discuss-phase Area 4):** Requirements 3 + 4 originally locked `200 OK + List<WorkflowReadDto>`; revised to `204 No Content`. v1 endpoint behavior is validation-only (no entity projection, no response payload). Future phases will add real orchestration logic and response bodies as needed.

## Background

**What exists today (verified in codebase):**
- `ProcessorsController` (`src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Processor/ProcessorController.cs:19`) is an empty body inheriting `BaseController<ProcessorEntity, ProcessorCreateDto, ProcessorUpdateDto, ProcessorReadDto>`. It exposes 5 CRUD verbs — no `GetBySourceHash`.
- `ProcessorEntity.SourceHash` (`src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Processor/ProcessorEntity.cs:25`) is a lowercase 64-char SHA-256 hex string with unique index `uq_processor_source_hash`.
- The 5 existing feature folders (`Schema`, `Processor`, `Step`, `Assignment`, `Workflow`) share a stable layout: `Entity + Dtos + Validator + Mapper + Service + Controller + ServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- No `Orchestration/` feature folder exists.
- `GetById` design (`src/BaseApi.Core/Controllers/BaseController.cs:50-55`): `[HttpGet("{id:guid}")] → Ok(_service.GetByIdAsync) → 404 via NotFoundException` handled by Phase 4 `NotFoundExceptionHandler`.
- Phase 4 exception-handler pipeline: `NotFoundException → 404 ProblemDetails`; `ValidationException → 400 ValidationProblemDetails`.

**What this phase delivers:** one extra method on `ProcessorsController` plus a new `Orchestration/` feature folder mirroring the existing folder layout (no entity, no migration). The Orchestration controller is a composition over `WorkflowService`; future endpoints will be added to this folder once orchestration semantics are designed.

## Requirements

1. **Processor.GetBySourceHash endpoint**: New endpoint on `ProcessorsController` that returns a single `ProcessorReadDto` by its `SourceHash`.
   - Current: No such endpoint exists. Looking up a Processor by hash requires a full-list scan client-side.
   - Target: `GET /api/v1/processors/by-source-hash/{sourceHash}` returns `200 OK + ProcessorReadDto` when a row matches; returns `404 ProblemDetails` via `NotFoundException` when no row matches (including off-format strings — no route-level validation in v1). Implemented as a direct method on `ProcessorsController` (concrete, NOT on `BaseController<>`); calls a new `ProcessorService.GetBySourceHashAsync(string sourceHash, CancellationToken)` method.
   - Acceptance: Integration test asserts 200 + correct `ProcessorReadDto` for a seeded row; integration test asserts 404 for a non-existent hash and for a malformed (non-hex / wrong-length) hash.

2. **OrchestrationController exists**: New `OrchestrationController` lives in a new `Features/Orchestration/` feature folder mirroring the existing folder layout.
   - Current: No `OrchestrationController` / `Features/Orchestration/` folder exists.
   - Target: `src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Orchestration/` contains `OrchestrationController.cs`, `OrchestrationService.cs`, `OrchestrationServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (with `AddOrchestrationFeature()`). The `OrchestrationService` composes over `WorkflowService` (or the abstract `BaseService<WorkflowEntity, …>`) — no entity, no DTOs of its own (request is bare `List<Guid>`, response is `List<WorkflowReadDto>` from the existing Workflow feature). `AddOrchestrationFeature()` is wired into `Program.cs` alongside the other `AddXxxFeature()` calls.
   - Acceptance: `dotnet build` is zero-warning. `Program.cs` calls `AddOrchestrationFeature()`. Folder layout matches the established Phase 8 feature-folder pattern.

3. **StartOrchestration endpoint** *(amended 2026-05-28)*: New endpoint on `OrchestrationController` accepting `List<Guid> WorkflowIds` and validating the list — no side-effects, no response body in v1.
   - Current: No such endpoint exists.
   - Target: `POST /api/v1/orchestration/start` with request body = bare JSON array of guids (e.g., `["g1","g2"]`); returns **`204 No Content`** on success. The endpoint runs the validator (Requirement 5) + the existence check (Requirement 6) and returns `204 No Content` once both pass. **No entity projection, no response payload, no actual orchestration side-effects in v1.**
   - Acceptance: Integration test asserts `204 No Content` with empty body for a body of valid, existing, distinct guids.

4. **StopOrchestration endpoint** *(amended 2026-05-28)*: New endpoint on `OrchestrationController`, behaviorally identical to `StartOrchestration` in v1, only the route segment differs.
   - Current: No such endpoint exists.
   - Target: `POST /api/v1/orchestration/stop` — same body shape, same response (204 No Content), same validation, same error semantics as Start. The only difference is the URL segment `/stop`. Both endpoints delegate to the same `OrchestrationService` method in v1; future divergence is out of scope for Phase 9.
   - Acceptance: Integration test mirrors the Start test: `204 No Content` with empty body for a valid body.

5. **Duplicate-id validation on Orchestration endpoints**: A `List<Guid>` body containing duplicate guids is rejected.
   - Current: No such endpoints exist, so no validation.
   - Target: Both `StartOrchestration` and `StopOrchestration` validate that the request body contains no duplicate guids. On duplicate, throw `FluentValidation.ValidationException` — the Phase 4 `ValidationExceptionHandler` maps it to `400 ValidationProblemDetails`. Same code path as Phase 6 / Phase 8 validation failures.
   - Acceptance: Integration test asserts `400 ValidationProblemDetails` when the body is `["g1","g1","g2"]`. Response shape matches existing Phase 4 validation-failure shape (no new error contract).

6. **Existence validation on Orchestration endpoints**: A `List<Guid>` body where any guid does not match an existing Workflow is rejected.
   - Current: No such endpoints exist, so no validation.
   - Target: Both endpoints check that EVERY guid in the body resolves to an existing Workflow row (all-or-nothing semantic mirroring `GetById`). On any miss, throw `NotFoundException` — the Phase 4 `NotFoundExceptionHandler` maps it to `404 ProblemDetails`. Same code path as `BaseService.GetByIdAsync` miss.
   - Acceptance: Integration test asserts `404 ProblemDetails` when the body contains a guid that does not match any Workflow row; response identifies the missing id(s) in `detail` (same shape as existing `NotFoundException` payload).

## Boundaries

**In scope:**
- One new method on `ProcessorsController` (`GetBySourceHash`)
- One new `ProcessorService.GetBySourceHashAsync` method (delegates to the repository / DbContext for a `WHERE source_hash = …` lookup)
- New `Features/Orchestration/` folder with `OrchestrationController + OrchestrationService + OrchestrationServiceCollectionExtensions`
- Two new endpoints on `OrchestrationController` (`StartOrchestration`, `StopOrchestration`), behaviorally identical in v1
- `Program.cs` updated to call `AddOrchestrationFeature()`
- Duplicate-id and existence validation via existing Phase 4/6 exception-handler pipeline (no new error shapes)
- Integration tests in `tests/BaseApi.Tests/Features/Processor/GetBySourceHashFacts.cs` and `tests/BaseApi.Tests/Features/Orchestration/StartOrchestrationFacts.cs` + `StopOrchestrationFacts.cs` covering hit, miss, duplicate, and missing-id paths

**Out of scope:**
- **Actual orchestration side-effects** (queueing jobs, starting/stopping runners, dispatching to external schedulers) — v1 endpoints only fetch Workflow entities by id; real orchestration is a future phase
- **New domain entities, DB tables, or EF migrations** — Orchestration is purely a controller+service composition over the existing Workflow feature; zero schema changes
- **Auth / authorization on the new endpoints** — endpoints remain anonymous in v1, matching the Phase 8 controller convention; auth is a separate concern
- **Persisting Start/Stop audit history** (no `orchestration_actions` table, no audit log records of who-started-what) — future concern
- **Idempotency keys / retry semantics** — no `Idempotency-Key` header support; v1 has no side-effect to deduplicate
- **Route-layer validation of sourceHash format** (no `:regex(...)` constraint, no request-DTO + FluentValidation) — off-format strings simply 404 on row-miss
- **A request DTO around the Orchestration `List<Guid>` body** — body is the bare list; no envelope object in v1
- **Diverging Start vs Stop behavior in v1** — they are functionally identical (same body, same validation, same response, same delegation); only the URL differs
- **A response body of any kind on Orchestration endpoints** — v1 returns `204 No Content`. No `OrchestrationReadDto`, no echoed `List<WorkflowReadDto>`. Response shape is deferred to future phases when real orchestration logic exists.

## Constraints

- `GetBySourceHash` must live on the **concrete** `ProcessorsController`, not on `BaseController<>` — `SourceHash` is processor-specific (not on `BaseEntity`).
- The route literal for `GetBySourceHash` must be `by-source-hash/{sourceHash}` (literal prefix) — a bare `{sourceHash}` would conflict with `BaseController.GetById`'s `{id:guid}` at route matching.
- All error responses MUST use the existing Phase 4 exception-handler pipeline (`NotFoundException → 404 ProblemDetails`, `ValidationException → 400 ValidationProblemDetails`). No new error shapes, no new exception types.
- Orchestration endpoints MUST return `204 No Content` on success — no response body, no DTO. Existence check is satisfied via a lightweight `SELECT id WHERE id IN (…)` projection; full entity hydration is NOT required.
- Orchestration request body MUST be a bare JSON array of guids (`List<Guid>`) — no envelope DTO.
- Zero-warning `dotnet build` (Debug + Release) per project-wide `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`.
- Existing Phase 1–8 test suite (128 facts) MUST remain GREEN — no regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `GET /api/v1/processors/by-source-hash/{sourceHash}` returns `200 OK + ProcessorReadDto` for an existing row

- [ ] `POST /api/v1/orchestration/start` (and `/stop`) with duplicate guids in the body returns `400 ValidationProblemDetails` via the Phase 4 `ValidationExceptionHandler`
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/orchestration/start` (and `/stop`) with any guid not matching a Workflow row returns `404 ProblemDetails` via the Phase 4 `NotFoundExceptionHandler`, identifying the missing id(s)
