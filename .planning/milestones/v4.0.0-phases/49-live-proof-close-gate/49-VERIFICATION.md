Live broker shows TWO queues: skp-dlq-1 (depth 0) AND skp-dlq-1_skipped (depth 3). ROOT CAUSE: skp-dlq-1 is declared as a MassTransit ReceiveEndpoint (MessagingServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:79, BaseConsole.Core) and ConsolidatedErrorTransportFilter forwards exhausted faults to exchange:skp-dlq-1 (the GAP-49-1 406-fix). The ReceiveEndpoint consumes the arriving message, finds NO registered consumer for the forwarded fault type, and MassTransit moves it to skp-dlq-1_skipped. So exhausted give-ups never PARK in skp-dlq-1. This also means the close gate's 'skp-dlq-1 depth==0' net-zero check is satisfied trivially while real give-ups accumulate in _skipped. STATE 1 (data-present REINJECT) passes, proving the bus publish + Keeper recovery path work; only the dead-letter PARKING is wrong."
    fix_direction: "DESIGN DECISION (touches the GAP-49-1 fix topology — user's spec call): either (a) make skp-dlq-1 a passive parking queue (declared, NOT a consuming ReceiveEndpoint) so forwarded faults stay observable in it, or (b) accept _skipped as the real resting place and re-point SC2 + the close-gate depth assertion at skp-dlq-1_skipped.

So the orchestrator's seam logs are NOT reaching Elasticsearch at all — likely the orchestrator service isn't exporting its console logs via OTLP to the collector (the 17828 docs are from other services), OR the otel log body field shape differs from the test's OrchestratorSeamQuery.

# Phase 49: Live Proof & Close Gate — Verification Report (Re-verification)

**Phase Goal:** A real-stack E2E proves the full Pre/In/Post round trip plus each recovery path and the BIT-gate global pause-all/resume-all across a transient L2 outage, all sealed behind an N-consecutive-GREEN triple-SHA (psql / redis / rabbitmq) net-zero close gate matching prior-milestone discipline.

**Verified:** 2026-06-09T14:00:00Z
**Status:** passed (resolved 2026-06-10) — the 2026-06-09 re-verification found GAP-49-3/4/5; those were code-closed in 49-06 (+ GAP-49-6..10) and the live N×GREEN close gate PASSED 2026-06-10 (exit 0, 3×GREEN/515, triple-SHA net-zero). See the `resolution:` frontmatter block + 49-HUMAN-UAT.md. The narrative below is the 2026-06-09 record.
**Re-verification:** Yes — after GAP-49-2 gap closure (plan 49-05, commits 081895f / 03e0129 / ddea4df)

---

## Live Run #2 (2026-06-09 — operator gate executed in-session by Claude)

After the GAP-49-2 fix landed, the v4 stack was rebuilt (baseapi-service, orchestrator, processor-sample, keeper) and `pwsh -File scripts/phase-49-close.ps1` was run. **Result: FAILED.** Run 1 of 3 returned **512 passed / 3 failed** (total 515); the gate exited 1 and never reached the 3×GREEN cadence. Both build configs were 0-warning and the triple-SHA machinery worked.

**GAP-49-2 is PROVEN FIXED:** `SC1RoundTripE2ETests` and `SampleRoundTripE2ETests` — the pure round-trip facts the scheduler-freeze previously killed — now PASS live. The first operator run had all 5 round-trip facts failing on the freeze; now only 3 fail and none is a scheduler freeze. The rebuilt orchestrator logs show `Global PauseAll` → `Global ResumeAll` cycling normally.

**The 3 remaining failures reproduce in isolation** (RealStack-only: 4 passed / 3 failed) — so they are deterministic, distinct downstream-infra defects, NOT full-suite load flakiness:

| Gap | Test | Failure | Root-caused? |
|-----|------|---------|--------------|
| GAP-49-3 | SC2 `LiveKeeperRecovery` (data-gone REINJECT, :142) | `skp-dlq-1` depth stayed 0 — give-ups land in `skp-dlq-1_skipped` (depth 3) instead | **YES** — `skp-dlq-1` is a consuming ReceiveEndpoint; forwarded faults have no consumer → MassTransit skips them to `_skipped`. Interacts with the GAP-49-1 exchange-routing fix. Also defeats the close-gate `skp-dlq-1 depth==0` net-zero check. |
| GAP-49-4 | SC3 `LiveBitGate...DockerStopStart` (:187) | `Global PauseAll` seam not found in ES within 150s | No — orchestrator emits the seam + ES has otel logs; needs SC3-alone instrumentation (BIT-gate timing vs ingestion lag vs query shape) |
| GAP-49-5 | MetricsRoundTrip (:140) | business metric series empty in Prometheus within poll window | No — needs live Prometheus targets + exposed-series check (scrape lag vs missing metric) |

See the `gaps:` frontmatter for full detail and the GAP-49-3 fix-direction design decision. Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 49 --gaps`.

## Gap Closure Summary

This is a re-verification following gap closure of GAP-49-2 (the sole open defect from the prior verification). The prior status was `gaps_found` with two defects:

- **GAP-49-1** (DLQ skp-dlq-1 406 poison-loop) — confirmed still resolved. Zero diff to `ConsolidatedErrorTransportFilter.cs` between commit `5666fb7` and HEAD. No regression.
- **GAP-49-2** (orchestrator Quartz scheduler stuck PAUSED for new workflows after pause-all/resume-all cycle) — **closed** by plan 49-05.

With both defects resolved, the only remaining item is the operator-gated live N×GREEN close run — correctly classified as `human_needed` per D-03, matching every prior milestone close.

---

## Phase Posture (D-03)

This is the FINAL phase of v4.0.0 — a LIVE-PROOF + CLOSE-GATE phase. Per decision D-03 (locked in 49-CONTEXT.md), the phase is complete when the proofs and close machinery are **authored and hermetically green**. The actual live N×GREEN close run is **OPERATOR-GATED** — it requires the rebuilt v4 stack and is tracked in `49-HUMAN-UAT.md`. TEST-01/02/03 intentionally stay unticked until the operator's GREEN live run. This matches every prior milestone close (Phase 39/35/36/33).

## GAP-49-2 Fix Verification (Plan 49-05)

### Fix Check 1: `WorkflowScheduler.ResumeAllGroupsAsync`

`src/Orchestrator/Scheduling/WorkflowScheduler.cs` — **VERIFIED**

- Method `ResumeAllGroupsAsync(CancellationToken ct)` exists at line 141.
- Implementation: `=> scheduler.ResumeAll(ct);`
- Doc-comment correctly explains why `ResumeAll()` (not `ResumeTriggers(GroupMatcher.AnyGroup())`) is used: in Quartz 3.18 RAMJobStore, `ResumeTriggers(matcher)` with an AnyGroup matcher unpauses existing triggers but does NOT remove the "pause future groups" flag from `pausedTriggerGroups`; only `ResumeAll()` clears that set wholesale.
- Method is idempotent (no-op when no group is paused).
- No `using Quartz.Impl.Matchers;` in `WorkflowScheduler.cs` (correctly removed since `GroupMatcher` is not referenced in live code, only in a doc-comment explaining the deviation).

### Fix Check 2: `ResumeAllConsumer.cs` — group-flag clear AFTER per-job loop

`src/Orchestrator/Consumers/ResumeAllConsumer.cs` — **VERIFIED, ORDERING CORRECT**

- `WorkflowScheduler scheduler` injected into the primary ctor (line 34) alongside the existing `IWorkflowL1Store`, `WorkflowLifecycle`, `ILogger`.
- `Consume` method body (lines 39-49):
  1. Log line (line 42)
  2. `foreach (var workflowId in store.WorkflowIds) await lifecycle.ResumeAsync(workflowId, context.CancellationToken);` (lines 43-44) — per-job fresh-from-now reschedule loop
  3. `await scheduler.ResumeAllGroupsAsync(context.CancellationToken);` (line 47) — group-flag clear AFTER the loop
- **Load-bearing ordering is correct:** the `ResumeAllGroupsAsync` call is textually and logically AFTER the foreach loop. No stale paused trigger exists by the time the group-flag clear runs (every workflow trigger was already replaced with a fresh-from-now Normal trigger in the loop).
- XML doc-comment (lines 11-31) explicitly states the new "no immediate-refire herd" contract, cites GAP-49-2/D-08/T-49-01, and explains the load-bearing ordering. No "MUST NEVER call native ResumeAll()" wording.

### Fix Check 3: `PauseAllConsumer.cs` UNCHANGED

`src/Orchestrator/Consumers/PauseAllConsumer.cs` — **VERIFIED UNCHANGED**

- Zero diff between commit `081895f` and HEAD for this file (confirmed via `git diff`).
- Still calls `scheduler.PauseAllAsync(context.CancellationToken)` on line 24 — atomic scheduler-wide `PauseAll()`. D-08 Option A preserved.

### Fix Check 4: Tests — ordering + no-herd + GAP-49-2 regression

`tests/BaseApi.Tests/Orchestrator/Consumers/ResumeNoBurstTests.cs` — **VERIFIED**

- `Native_ResumeAll_Is_Never_Called` fact: ABSENT (confirmed by grep — zero matches).
- `Group_Resume_Runs_After_Per_Job_Reschedules` fact: PRESENT (lines 65-93).
  - Uses NSubstitute `IScheduler` spy, baselines call count after hydration (`callsBefore`), runs Consume, walks the Consume-time `ReceivedCalls()` timeline.
  - Asserts `resumeAllIndex > lastScheduleJobIndex` (group-level `ResumeAll` must run after the last per-job `ScheduleJob`).
  - Asserts `await spy.Received(1).ResumeAll(Arg.Any<CancellationToken>())` — exactly one group-level clear.
  - `callsBefore` baseline prevents the hydration-time ScheduleJob from contaminating the ordering assertion (WR-01/IN-01 fix from commit ddea4df).
- `Resume_Reschedules_Fresh_From_Now_StartAt_Ge_Now` fact: PRESENT (lines 96-123).
  - Also baselines `callsBefore` to inspect only Consume-time reschedules (ddea4df hardening).
  - `Assert.All(scheduled, t => Assert.True(t.StartTimeUtc >= before, ...))` — no-herd guarantee across ALL reschedules.
- `Build` helper passes `workflowScheduler` to `ResumeAllConsumer` ctor.
- No `ResumeTriggers` reference in the file (the AnyGroup API is not used — confirmed by grep: zero matches).

`tests/BaseApi.Tests/Orchestrator/Consumers/ResumeAllConsumerTests.cs` — **VERIFIED**

- `Normal_After_PauseAll_Resume_Cycle` fact: PRESENT (lines 140-186), `[Trait("Phase","49")]`.
  - Drives the TRUE production path over a real Quartz RAMJobStore.
  - Seeds W1 into L1 + Quartz; drives `PauseAllConsumer.Consume` (calls real `scheduler.PauseAll()`); asserts W1 is `TriggerState.Paused`.
  - Drives `ResumeAllConsumer.Consume`; asserts W1 is back to `TriggerState.Normal`.
  - **THE GAP-49-2 ASSERTION (lines 175-180):** schedules brand-new W2 AFTER the cycle via `lifecycle.HydrateAndScheduleAsync(w2.id, ct)`; asserts `TriggerState.Normal` (not Paused) AND `GetNextFireTimeUtc() > DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`. This is the exact GAP-49-2 reproduction — FAILS pre-fix, PASSES post-fix.
- `Consume_Enumerates_WorkflowIds_And_Calls_ResumeAsync_Each`: `WorkflowScheduler` now passed to ctor.
- `Resume_Of_Non_Paused_Trigger_Is_Ignored`: `WorkflowScheduler` now passed to ctor.
- Lines-68-71 group-semantics workaround comment: ABSENT (retired per plan).

### API Deviation from Plan 49-05

The plan spec'd `scheduler.ResumeTriggers(GroupMatcher<TriggerKey>.AnyGroup(), ct)` for the group-flag clear. The implementation uses `scheduler.ResumeAll(ct)`. This deviation is:

- **Documented** as an auto-fixed Rule 1 (Bug) in `49-05-SUMMARY.md` under Deviations.
- **Empirically necessary:** `ResumeTriggers(AnyGroup())` in Quartz 3.18 RAMJobStore does NOT clear `pausedTriggerGroups` — confirmed by `Normal_After_PauseAll_Resume_Cycle` failing with the AnyGroup API and passing with `ResumeAll()`.
- **Spec-permitted:** D-08 CONTEXT (49-CONTEXT.md line 43) explicitly states "the literal native `scheduler.ResumeAll()` may stay avoided in favor of `ResumeTriggers(GroupMatcher.AnyGroup())`" — i.e. `ResumeTriggers` was suggested, not mandated. The binding guarantee is the no-herd ordering, not the API name.
- **Override accepted** (see frontmatter `overrides:` section for `ResumeNoBurstTests.cs contains 'ResumeTriggers'`).

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Not applicable — all artifacts are authored test proofs and an operator script, not production components rendering dynamic data from a data store. Verified at Level 3 (wired); data-flow is by construction (the tests assert specific data keys are written/deleted on the live stack, proven by the operator-gated live run).

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| TEST-01 | Plans 01, 02, 04, 05 | Real-stack E2E proves full Pre/In/Post round trip + each recovery path | AUTHORED — operator-gated | SC1 (round-trip) + SC2 (recovery-paths) exist and are hermetically green. GAP-49-2 fix unblocks the live gate. Unticked per D-03 until operator GREEN run. |
| TEST-02 | Plans 03, 04, 05 | Real-stack proof of BIT-gate pause-all/resume-all across transient L2 outage | AUTHORED — operator-gated | SC3 exists; GAP-49-2 fix ensures the pause-all/resume-all cycle no longer leaves the scheduler stuck for new workflows. Unticked per D-03 until operator GREEN run. |
| TEST-03 | Plans 04, 05 | Close gate N consecutive GREEN + triple-SHA net-zero | AUTHORED — operator-gated | `scripts/phase-49-close.ps1` exists, 388 lines, triple-SHA protocol, N=3, single `skp-dlq-1`. GAP-49-2 fix removes the code-level blocker that was sinking the live run. Unticked per D-03 until operator GREEN run. |

All three TEST-XX requirements are correctly unticked in `REQUIREMENTS.md` per the operator-gate posture (D-03). This is by design — not a gap.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | — | — | — | No stubs, no empty handlers, no TODO blockers found. |

The two new production files (`WorkflowScheduler.cs` change, `ResumeAllConsumer.cs` change) are real implementations with substantive doc-comments and correct Quartz API calls. The two test file changes are genuine behavioral tests over real RAM schedulers and NSubstitute spies. No empty returns, no placeholder implementations.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Live N×GREEN Close Gate Run (Operator-gated, D-03)

**Test:** On the host with the rebuilt v4 container stack running, execute:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build baseapi-service orchestrator processor-sample keeper
docker compose up -d postgres redis rabbitmq otel-collector elasticsearch prometheus orchestrator processor-sample baseapi-service keeper
pwsh -File scripts/phase-49-close.ps1
```

**Expected:**
- Exit code 0
- Both build configs (`-c Release`, `-c Debug`) 0-warning
- All 3 test runs GREEN with identical `Passed` fact count (508 expected)
- psql `\l` SHA-256: BEFORE == AFTER
- redis `--scan` SHA-256: BEFORE == AFTER (composite `corr:wf:proc:exec` namespace proven net-zero by E2E teardown)
- rabbitmq `list_queues name` SHA-256: BEFORE == AFTER
- `skp-dlq-1` depth == 0

Record the 3 SHA values + Passed count + DLQ depth in `49-HUMAN-UAT.md` Step 3 table, then tick TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03 in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

**Why human:** The RealStack E2E facts require the rebuilt v4 container stack. SC3 invokes `docker stop sk-redis` against a live redis container. The triple-SHA gate snapshots live postgres/redis/rabbitmq state. None of this can be verified without the running stack. Both prior live-run defects are now resolved: GAP-49-1 (commit `5666fb7`) and GAP-49-2 (commits `081895f`/`03e0129`/`ddea4df`). No code-level blockers remain.

---

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 4 original authored-hermetic must-haves remain verified (SC1, SC2, SC3, SC4 — zero regressions confirmed). GAP-49-2 is closed and verified at code level: `WorkflowScheduler.ResumeAllGroupsAsync` wraps `scheduler.ResumeAll(ct)`; `ResumeAllConsumer` calls it exactly once AFTER the per-job loop; `Normal_After_PauseAll_Resume_Cycle` regression locks the fix against re-regression; `PauseAllConsumer` is unchanged. The only remaining item is the operator-gated live run, correctly classified as `human_needed` per D-03.
