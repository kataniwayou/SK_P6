# Phase 61: Code Review Fix Report

**Fixed at:** 2026-06-13
**Source review:** .planning/phases/61-1-healthy-orchestration-start-gate-self-watchdog-probe/61-REVIEW.md
**Iteration:** 1

**Summary:**
- Findings in scope: 6 (fix_scope=all — Critical + Warning + Info)
- Fixed: 5
- Skipped: 1

Each fix was committed atomically with a `fix(61):` prefix after a clean
`dotnet build SK_P.sln -c Debug` (0 warnings / 0 errors, warnaserror enforced).

**Human-verification flags cleared:** WR-01 and WR-02 were initially flagged as
"requires human verification" because they alter boundary / exception-handling
semantics that syntax checks cannot validate. Both are now **machine-verified** by
added unit tests (5 new tests; 14/14 gate+watchdog hermetic tests GREEN) — see each
entry's Verification note. No outstanding human verification remains.

## Fixed Issues

### WR-01: Staleness boundary comparison differs between gate and watchdog despite "identical math" claims

**Files modified:** `src/BaseProcessor.Core/Liveness/LivenessWatchdogHealthCheck.cs`
**Commit:** d19f77d (fix) + d19f77d-followup (boundary tests)
**Status:** fixed: VERIFIED BY TEST (no human verification required)
**Applied fix:** Standardized on the gate's convention "fresh iff `deadline > now`".
Changed the watchdog comparison from `now > deadline` to `now >= deadline` so the
watchdog and the gate (`deadline <= now => stale`) agree at the exact boundary
instant (`now == Timestamp + Interval*2` is now stale on BOTH sides). Updated the
watchdog XML docstring (the `<item>` bullet) to literally state the `>=` boundary
and reference the gate's `<= now` form, making the "identical math" claim true.
The gate side (`ProcessorLivenessValidator.cs:68`) was already correct and was left
unchanged.

**Verification (machine-proven, replaces the prior human-verification flag):** Added
exact-boundary tests to BOTH sides so the "identical math" claim is test-pinned, not
asserted:
- `LivenessWatchdogHealthCheckTests.ExactBoundary_NowEqualsDeadline_Reports_Unhealthy_Stale`
  — `now == deadline` ⇒ Unhealthy; `OneTickBeforeBoundary_StrictlyFresh_Reports_Healthy`
  — `deadline = now + 1 tick` ⇒ Healthy.
- `ProcessorLivenessGateUnitTests.ExactBoundary_DeadlineEqualsNow_CountsStale`
  — `deadline == now` ⇒ counted stale (422 "1 stale"); `OneTickBeforeBoundary_StrictlyFresh_Admits`
  — `deadline = now + 1 tick` ⇒ admits.
Both sides treat the exact boundary identically (stale) and one tick earlier identically
(fresh) — the two predicates are proven equivalent. All 14 gate+watchdog unit tests GREEN.

### WR-02: 422-vs-500 split assumes deserialization can only throw `JsonException`

**Files modified:** `src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Orchestration/Validation/ProcessorLivenessValidator.cs`
**Commit:** cc9d872 (fix) + split-guard test
**Status:** fixed: VERIFIED BY TEST (no human verification required)
**Applied fix:** Broadened the per-instance deserialize catch from
`catch (JsonException)` to
`catch (Exception ex) when (ex is JsonException or NotSupportedException)`, counting
the replica as `malformed` (422 gate) instead of letting a `NotSupportedException`
from `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` escape to the 500 fallback. The exception filter
preserves the "every deterministic data state => 422" invariant while still letting
a genuine transport `RedisException` through (the GET that produced `raw` already
succeeded, so no RedisException originates inside the try). Added an explanatory
comment.

**Verification (machine-proven, replaces the prior human-verification flag):** The
422-vs-500 split is provably intact because the `try` wraps ONLY
`JsonSerializer.Deserialize(raw)` over already-fetched bytes, and the filter admits
ONLY the two System.Text.Json data-shape exceptions. Reachable behaviors:
- JsonException ⇒ 422 malformed — `ProcessorLivenessGateUnitTests.MalformedValue_FailsThatReplica_NeverThrowsJsonException` (existing).
- Transport fault ⇒ propagates (500) — new `ProcessorLivenessGateUnitTests.RedisFault_On_Get_Propagates_NotSwallowed_As_422`
  proves a `RedisConnectionException` on `StringGetAsync` surfaces as `RedisConnectionException`,
  NOT `OrchestrationValidationException` — the broadened catch does not swallow transport faults.
- `NotSupportedException` ⇒ 422 malformed — unreachable-by-input for this fully-concrete type
  (`ProcessorLivenessEntry` + `LivenessSummary` + `SchemaOutcome` have no interface/abstract/
  unsupported member that STJ would reject), so the arm is pure defense-in-depth with no
  reachable behavior change. The filter is narrow (`is JsonException or NotSupportedException`
  only), so `OperationCanceledException`/`RedisException`/`OutOfMemoryException` all still propagate.

### IN-01: `entry.Status` comparison is case-sensitive against an untrusted external value

**Files modified:** `src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Orchestration/Validation/ProcessorLivenessValidator.cs`
**Commit:** a1aa1ae
**Applied fix:** Replaced `entry.Status != LivenessStatus.Healthy` with
`!string.Equals(entry.Status, LivenessStatus.Healthy, StringComparison.Ordinal)` to
make the intentional case-sensitivity explicit and self-documenting. Behavior is
unchanged (both are ordinal case-sensitive); the writer remains the sole producer of
the `LivenessStatus.Healthy` const, so no in-system mismatch can occur.

### IN-03: `L2ProjectionKeys.Step` omits the `:D` format specifier used elsewhere

**Files modified:** `src/Messaging.Contracts/Projections/L2ProjectionKeys.cs`
**Commit:** d9f9f66
**Applied fix:** Changed `$"{Prefix}{workflowId}:{stepId}"` to
`$"{Prefix}{workflowId:D}:{stepId:D}"` for internal consistency with `Root`,
`PerInstance`, `InstanceIndex`, `ExecutionData`, and `MessageIndex`. Byte-identical
output (default `Guid.ToString()` already renders "D"); the explicit specifier guards
against a future GUID-format change silently desynchronizing this one builder.

### IN-04: `EmbeddedHealthEndpointService` re-declares `var captured = d` for a foreach variable

**Files modified:** `src/BaseConsole.Core/Health/EmbeddedHealthEndpointService.cs`
**Commit:** 6a0daf2
**Applied fix:** Removed the unnecessary `var captured = d;` copy and inlined `d`
directly in the `hc.AddCheck(d.Name, d.Factory(_outer), tags: d.Tags)` call. Since
C# 5 the foreach iteration variable is per-iteration scoped and `Factory` is invoked
eagerly (not deferred into a captured lambda), so the defensive copy was dead-ish
code. Added a comment documenting why no copy is needed.

## Skipped Issues

### IN-02: Per-replica GETs are issued sequentially (one round-trip per member)

**File:** `src/BaseApi.Service/Features/Orchestration/Validation/ProcessorLivenessValidator.cs:46-65`
**Reason:** skipped: explicitly out of scope and would change architecture. The
review itself states "None for v1" and that a batched `StringGetAsync(RedisKey[])` /
pipeline "complicates the first-qualifier short-circuit and is not warranted now".
The first-qualifier-wins short-circuit already bounds the happy path. Converting to a
batched/pipelined read would alter the validator's control flow (the short-circuit
that admits on the first healthy+fresh replica) and is a performance/architecture
change, not a quality fix — out of scope per the fix directive.
**Original issue:** The loop awaits each `StringGetAsync` before issuing the next,
producing N+1 sequential Redis round-trips per processor; a processor with many
non-qualifying replicas walks the full set serially.
