# Steps API — Milestones

## v12.0.0 Resilience & Health-Probe Hardening (Shipped: 2026-07-27)

**Tag:** `v12.0.0`
**Archives:** [milestones/v12.0.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v12.0.0-ROADMAP.md) · [milestones/v12.0.0-REQUIREMENTS.md](milestones/v12.0.0-REQUIREMENTS.md)
**Phases completed:** 1 phase (86), 9 plans. **Requirements:** HLTH-01…HLTH-08 all satisfied.

**Delivered:** Every service now tolerates an infrastructure outage (Postgres/Redis/RabbitMQ) without crash-looping. The category error that made keeper + processor crash-loop under an unreachable broker — a self-watchdog tagged `"live"` so an infra fault tripped *liveness* (restart) — is corrected: `/health/live` answers only "is my watchdog loop still turning?", `/health/ready` carries the required infra deps (NotReady, never restart), and recovery from a sustained outage is by operator restart, not self-heal (a hard readiness latch).

**Key accomplishments:**

- **One shared `BaseConsole.Core` liveness primitive (Phase 86, HLTH-01/03/06).** `ILivenessHeartbeat` + `LoopLivenessHealthCheck` (k=3 strict-boundary staleness over `TimeProvider`, `Interlocked` long-ticks), opt-in via `AddConsoleLivenessWatchdog`. Keeper (`BitHealthLoop`) + processor (`ProcessorLivenessHeartbeat`) `Beat()` as the literal first statement of their loop — before any infra I/O and above the `IsHealthy` gate (gate now guards only the L2 write); keeper edge bus-ops bounded with `WaitAsync(3s)` so a dead broker can't starve the beat. Orchestrator stays `self`-only. The two divergent per-service watchdogs (`KeeperLivenessWatchdogHealthCheck` + state, `BaseProcessor LivenessWatchdogHealthCheck`) retired/deleted.
- **Hard readiness latch + Redis on readiness (HLTH-04/05/08).** `/health/ready` = required infra deps + (processor) identity+schema; a sticky no-self-heal latch (`LatchedReadinessHealthCheck` / `ApiLatchedReadinessHealthCheck`) holds Unhealthy until process restart once a required dep fails its failureThreshold window. Redis newly included; baseapi bus stays soft/Degraded and unlatched (publish-relationship, not a required dep).
- **k8s startupProbes (HLTH-07).** `startupProbe → /health/startup` on all four deployments (30/31/32/33-*.yaml) with a ~150s grace window covering a ~40s rabbitmq cold start.
- **Proven LIVE — twice (HLTH-02).** Broker-unreachable experiment on Docker-Desktop k8s (deployed under unique tags to defeat the `:local` stale-image trap): all four services stayed **`RESTARTS 0`** over 4+ minutes, went NotReady (`/health/live` 200, `/health/ready` 503), logged caught `BrokerUnreachableException`, recovered only on restart. Re-run against the code-review-fixed bits (`p86fix-8af3adc`) — same result; CR-01's sanitized readiness message confirmed live.
- **Code review (advisory) surfaced + fixed a Critical info-disclosure.** CR-01: `/health/ready` could leak inner driver exception detail before the latch trips — fixed (both latch mirrors return a static message on every Unhealthy path). WR-01/02/03/04/06 + IN-01/03 fixed; WR-05 applied-then-reverted after post-fix verification caught it regressing a reachable-but-cold Redis to false NotReady.

**Known deferred items at close:** 7 (all stale/orphaned pre-existing, none v12.0.0 regressions — see STATE.md → Deferred Items): 1 debug session (phase29, v3.x) + 6 quick-tasks with `missing` status (dangling index refs, incl. `260614-b5c` — the keeper self-watchdog that Phase 86 retired). v12.0.0 was operator-closed without `/gsd:audit-milestone` (single-phase milestone already verified 8/8 + live-proven twice).

**⚠ Documented debt — v11.0.0 unarchived:** The prior milestone **v11.0.0 (Framework Data-Channel & Processor Boundary Hardening, phases 84–85)** is complete in work but was NEVER formally closed; the central `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` still tracks its DATA/PB requirements and phases 84–85 remain in `.planning/phases/`. v12.0.0 was therefore archived **phase-86-only** to avoid conflating them (the milestone-completion CLI's all-un-archived-phases sweep would otherwise mix 84/85 into v12.0.0). Close v11.0.0 separately when ready. (Same pattern as the noted v9.0.0 debt.)

## v10.0.0 Orchestrator High Availability (Shipped: 2026-07-19)

**Tag:** `v10.0.0`
**Archives:** [milestones/v10.0.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v10.0.0-ROADMAP.md) · [milestones/v10.0.0-REQUIREMENTS.md](milestones/v10.0.0-REQUIREMENTS.md)
**Phases completed:** 2 phases (82–83), 9 plans. **Requirements:** HA-01…HA-07 all satisfied.

**Delivered:** The orchestrator now runs as N≥2 replicas on k8s with single-leader mutual exclusion — horizontal scaling never produces duplicate workflow triggers, failover is bounded (seconds), and observability is role-tagged. Only the elected leader performs scheduler-triggered entry-step sends; followers run every other path unchanged.

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Kubernetes-Lease leader election (Phase 82, HA-01…HA-06).** A `LeaderElectionService : BackgroundService` runs the `KubernetesClient` `LeaderElector` over a `coordination.k8s.io/v1` Lease (`skp/orchestrator-leader`; LeaseDuration 15s / RenewDeadline 10s / RetryPeriod 2s self-demotion fence); its callbacks are the single writer of a volatile immutable-record `LeaderState`. `WorkflowFireJob` gates ONLY the entry-step `foreach…DispatchAsync` loop on `IsLeader && IsReady` (a follower still mints the correlationId, refreshes L1, reschedules); `RelocateTail`/step-advancement stays ungated. Least-privilege RBAC + `replicas:3` + RollingUpdate + `KubernetesClient` 18.0.13.
- **`attributes.role` on every orchestrator log (HA-05).** `OrchestratorRoleLogEnricher` stamps `leader|follower` from live `LeaderState` — verified live in ES (2,419 role-stamped docs; failover flip visible).
- **HA-07 proven LIVE (Phase 83).** Automated verdict `Pass` (exit 0): leader force-killed at `replicas:3`, all five claims green — zero duplicate triggers (≤1 send-correlationId per 30s tick), one election-gap tick skipped-not-backfilled, role flip visible, single-leader recovery **15.44s** (≤2×LeaseDuration). Built as a Docker-less scorer + hermetic facts + RealStack verdict fact + `scripts/phase-83-ha-failover.ps1` kill-sequencer; artifact `analyzer-reports/phase-83-ha.json`.
- **The live proof caught + fixed a real Phase-82 defect (HA-blocking).** The orchestrator could not run `replicas:3` — its fan-out consumer definitions pinned a fixed `EndpointName` that (MassTransit 8.5.5) bypasses the per-pod `InstanceId` formatter → exclusive queues collided (`RESOURCE_LOCKED`). Gap-closure plan 83-05: per-instance `e.Name` via `OrchestratorFanoutEndpoints`, hermetic guard. (Plus a scorer same-bucket gap-detection fix and a documented Docker-Desktop stale-`:local`-image deploy trap.)

**Known deferred items at close:** 8 (mostly stale carry-overs already tracked — see STATE.md → Deferred Items): 1 debug session (phase29, v3.x), 5 quick-tasks (v8.0.0-era), Phase 70 UAT/verification `human_needed` (v9.0.0).

**⚠ Documented debt — v9.0.0 unarchived:** The prior milestone **v9.0.0 (Canonical Two-Consumer Recovery & L2 Delivery Proof, phases 69–81)** is complete but was NEVER archived; its `REQUIREMENTS.md` was overwritten when v10.0.0 began, so it has no `milestones/v9.0.0-*` archive. Phases 69–81 remain in git history and the archived v10.0.0-ROADMAP.md snapshot. Reconstruct/close separately if a formal v9.0.0 archive is later needed (operator decision 2026-07-19: leave as documented debt).

## v8.0.0 E2E Resilience Proof (Shipped: 2026-06-15)

**Phases completed:** 6 phases (63–68), 15 plans

**Requirements:** 23/23 satisfied (CRON/PROC/WF/ENV/FAULT/OBS/TEST) · **Audit:** none run (operator-skipped) · **Close posture:** 7-scenario live capstone **7/7 PASS** (Prometheus + Elasticsearch only) across all fault classes

**Stats:** 139 commits (18 feat / 21 fix) · 136 files changed (+18,800 / −1,202) · 2026-06-14 → 2026-06-15

**Known deferred items at close:** 32 (carried over from prior un-closed milestones v3.x–v7.0.0 — UAT/verification `human_needed` on phases 08/09/32–40, 1 stale debug session [phase29], 5 quick-task summaries [260614/260615], Phase-62 pending UAT; none are v8.0.0 regressions — see STATE.md → Deferred Items)

### TEST-06 — initial miss, root cause, and config-only fix

- The initial sweep was **6/7**: **TEST-06 (RabbitMQ) MISSING:2**, traced to the by-design `ReinjectConsumer.cs:37` silent-DROP — the leftover 5s `Processor__ExecutionDataTtl` self-expired across the 45s outage so keeper REINJECT correctly dropped already-gone keys (`KeeperReinjectDroppedDelta:2 == Missing:2`). Corroborated by TEST-07 (strictly-harder redis+rabbitmq superset) PASS — a deterministic rabbitmq-recovery defect would have failed TEST-07 too, confirming **no recovery-logic defect**.
- **Spec-owner-directed config-only fix:** `Processor__ExecutionDataTtl` raised 5→300 in `compose.yaml` (the `"5"` was an obsolete v6.0.0 close-gate hack, dead once v8.0.0 retired the triple-SHA net-zero gate). TEST-06 re-ran a **clean PASS** (Missing:0, `KeeperReinjectDroppedDelta` 2→0) → **capstone 7/7**, zero production source touched (da91d32). TTL later unified to the const + `SlotArrayOptions` removed via quick-task 260615-dbf.

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Seconds-granularity cron (CRON-01/02):** lifted the 1-minute cron floor — a shared `CronFieldForm` token-count detector (zero Cronos dep, in `Messaging.Contracts.Projections`) routes both `CronInterval` (NextOccurrence + IntervalSeconds) and both Workflow create/update validators through 6-field (IncludeSeconds) / 5-field (Standard) resolution; `*/30 * * * * *` fires every 30s (UTC) and validates, 5-field still accepted.
- **Processor work + structured logging (PROC-01/02/03):** `SampleConfig(int Number, string? Label)` deserialized from the assignment payload; `ProcessAsync` sum = Number + `Random.Shared.Next(0,100)` → `{number,label}` JSON result + one `Step_<label>` structured log carrying correlationId + stepId so ES can aggregate a run.
- **Fan-out seeder + clean-state stack (WF-01/02, ENV-01/02):** idempotent reverse-topo seeder for `A→B→C→{D1→E1→F1, D2→E2→F2}` (9 steps/8 edges/9 assignments, 1 shared processor, `*/30` cron, sentinel `v8-fanout-proof`); `scripts/phase-65-reset.ps1` (FLUSHALL → heal-wait → FK-safe psql DELETE → processor-set assert) + minimal single-`processor-sample` stack bring-up.
- **Prometheus + ES analyzer / PASS-FAIL engine (OBS-01/02/03/04):** aggregates ES logs by correlationId into per-run traces (9 steps + both sinks), detects MISSING/DUPLICATE vs total triggers, cross-checks Prom counters, emits per-test report + automated verdict; OBS-04 verdict re-founded on an ES-binding arbiter (Prom→non-fatal corroboration), correcting a Phase-66 per-run-denominator defect surfaced under the first real fan-out load.
- **Fault-injection harness (FAULT-01/02/03):** `scripts/phase-67-harness.ps1` drives clean → seed → activate (`POST /orchestration/start`) → 5-min/30s-cron observe → mid-run container kill/restart → health-wait → analyze → teardown, fully automated; proven live on TEST-01 baseline + TEST-02 processor-crash recovery (both Pass 10/10).
- **7-scenario live capstone (TEST-01..07):** `scripts/phase-68-sweep.ps1` ran the full sweep — happy path + processor/orchestrator/keeper/redis/rabbitmq/redis+rabbitmq crashes — **7/7 PASS** (zero-missing + effect-once each); recovery machinery live-proven across all 7 fault classes (initial 6/7; TEST-06 re-ran clean after the config-only TTL fix, above).

## v7.0.0 Per-Replica Processor Liveness & Self-Watchdog (Closed: 2026-06-14 — audit-override)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases (59–61) + 1 inserted (62.1), 12 plans · Phase 62 (live proof + close gate) authored but NOT run

**Requirements:** 17/17 functional (KEY/STATE/LOOP/L1/GATE/PROBE) implemented & hermetically green; G-62-01 refresh-decouple fix hermetically green · **Close gate:** ⚠ NOT run (audit-override)

### Known Gaps

- **TEST-01/02/03 (Phase 62) — live close gate NOT executed.** The milestone is feature-complete and hermetically green, but the triple-SHA N=3 live-proof close gate never ran. v7.0.0 was closed by operator decision to start **v8.0.0 (E2E Resilience Proof)**, whose comprehensive live fault-injection E2E (7 scenarios over 5 min each, verified solely from Prometheus + Elasticsearch) **supersedes** Phase 62's narrower per-replica-liveness live proof.

**Known deferred items at close:** 29 (carried over from prior shipped milestones v3.x — UAT/verification `human_needed` on phases 08/09/32–40, 1 stale debug session, 3 quick-task summaries; plus Phase-62 pending UAT — see STATE.md → Deferred Items)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Per-instance L2 keyspace (KEY-01..04):** replaced the single last-write-wins liveness key `skp:{processorId}` with per-instance keys `skp:proc:{processorId}:{instanceId}` under a per-processor instance-index SET `skp:proc:{processorId}` (TTL = source of truth; index = lazily-`SREM`'d discovery hint); `instanceId` reuses the existing POD_NAME→HOSTNAME→MachineName→GUID identity; `inputDefinition`/`outputDefinition` dropped from L2 (liveness-only value).
- **Two-state health + per-schema summary (STATE-01..03):** liveness value carries `status ∈ {healthy, unhealthy}` + `summary {inputSchema, outputSchema, configSchema}`; a starting/failed replica writes `unhealthy` (visible, never absent); `configSchema` reuses the v6.0.0 Gate A outcome.
- **Dual-loop writer + in-memory L1 (LOOP-01..04, L1-01):** startup + heartbeat loops both write L2 + update an in-memory L1 record each iteration; split startup/heartbeat intervals; frozen-healthy once heartbeat starts; per-instance key TTL'd.
- **≥1-healthy orchestration-start gate (GATE-01..03):** WebAPI gate `SMEMBERS`→`GET`-each, admits iff ≥1 replica present+healthy+fresh, else 422 + RFC 7807; lazy-`SREM`s absent members (presence no longer implies live).
- **Self-watchdog liveness probe (PROBE-01/02):** reads in-memory L1 staleness (active-interval ×2 grace), reports `unhealthy` + the per-schema summary on a silently-crashed loop (K8s wiring deferred).
- **G-62-01 liveness-refresh decouple (Phase 62.1):** liveness-timestamp refresh decoupled from `IsHealthy` so an alive-but-unhealthy replica stays observably Unhealthy (never absent) and is not falsely restarted by the self-watchdog.

## v6.0.0 Config & Payload Validation Hardening (Shipped: 2026-06-13)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 11 plans, 21 tasks

**Requirements:** 10/10 CFG satisfied (CFG-01..10) · **Audit:** passed · **Close gate:** Phase-58 live N=3 GREEN, triple-SHA net-zero

**Known deferred items at close:** 25 (all carried over from prior shipped milestones v3.x — UAT/verification gaps on phases 08/09/32–40 + 1 stale debug session; none in v6.0.0 scope — see STATE.md → Deferred Items)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Typed base-config seam (CFG-01/02):** reshaped the `BaseProcessor` author seam from a raw-string config parameter to a framework-deserialized typed config instance (`BaseProcessor<TConfig>` + empty marker `ProcessorConfig` with one canonical `JsonSerializerOptions`); migrated `Processor.Sample` onto it with the old raw-string seam removed (clean break).
- **Startup config-schema fetch (CFG-03/04):** Loop B now fetches the `ConfigSchemaId` definition onto `ProcessorContext.ConfigDefinition`, lifting the D-05 carve-out; a missing definition stays transient (per-Id retry, boot-before-register tolerated).
- **Gate A compatibility check (CFG-05/06/07):** `ConfigSchemaCoverageCheck` performs a real `schema ⊨ TConfig` structural walk under the exact serializer name+type rules (18 rule-table rows green, spike-confirmed CLASH verdicts); on a clash the processor stays up but never reaches Healthy (`MarkHealthy` withheld, no bind, one Error log, terminal); null `ConfigSchemaId` skips Gate A.
- **TOCTOU closure (CFG-10):** a schema `Definition` freezes the moment any `ProcessorEntity` FK references it — `SchemaService.UpdateAsync` rejects a referenced-schema body change with `SchemaDefinitionFrozenException` → RFC-7807 409, closing the Gate-A↔Gate-B mutation window by construction; Name/Description and unreferenced-draft edits still flow.
- **Orchestration-gate integration proof (CFG-08/09):** new `Processor.BadConfig` container (behind a `badconfig` compose profile) + `GateACompositionE2ETests` prove live that a config-incompatible processor is blocked 422 at orchestration start (three-signal: ES clash log + `skp:{badId}` absent + 422) while a compatible one reaches Healthy and starts 204 — Gate A is not a false-positive blocker.
- **Sealed behind the close gate:** Phase-58 operator-gated N=3 consecutive GREEN run, triple-SHA (psql/redis/rabbitmq) BEFORE==AFTER net-zero, DLQ depth 0, both build configs 0-warning.

## v4.0.0 Processor Pre/In/Post-Process + Keeper Recovery Redesign (Shipped: 2026-06-11)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 27 plans, 60 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] IKeeperRecoverable inheriting ICorrelated hid CorrelationId from reflection
- Adapted the four execution-path consumer files to Plan-02's six-id no-H Guid-entryId contracts using the simplest straight-through behavior — made entryId a Guid end-to-end, seeded Guid.Empty at the entry-step fire, deleted the flag[H]/CAS dedup (RETIRE-01) + content-addressing + manifest fan-out (RETIRE-02) + the placeholder Redis result read, re-targeted ResultConsumer to IConsumer<StepCompleted>, and re-shaped EntryStepDispatchConsumer to emit one StepCompleted/StepFailed/StepCancelled per result — both target projects compile 0/0 against the new symbols.
- Kept the reactive Keeper recovery path DARK-but-compiling against Plan-02's reshaped contracts (D-14): rebound KeeperRecoveryHandler off the removed IExecutionCorrelated.H onto a local CompositeBackup 4-tuple key, retyped L2ProbeRecovery to the surviving ExecutionData(Guid) overload, and neutralized the now-unresolvable Fault<ExecutionResult> consumer by retargeting it onto StepCompleted + dropping its registration — while retaining the reactive recovery FEATURE registered on Fault<EntryStepDispatch>. Keeper builds clean 0/0; zero files deleted; the feature's real retirement stays RETIRE-03 (Phases 47/48).
- MTP ignores the VSTest `--filter` (warning MTP0001).
- Five additive author-contract source files (ProcessOutcome/ProcessItem/ProcessStatusException family, RetryLoop surface-not-throw helper, KeyAbsentException sentinel) plus the RESIL-01 RetryLoopFacts — the Wave-0 foundation Plan 02 composes from, with the old ProcessResult/ProcessAsync seam left untouched and the solution still GREEN.
- The load-bearing Phase-44 behavior change: a new `ProcessorPipeline` runner implements the explicit Pre→In→Post→`finally`-end-delete flow with the five terminals (REINJECT / UPDATE→write→CLEANUP / INJECT / DELETE + business StepFailed/StepCancelled/StepProcessing) proven hermetically, the `BaseProcessor` seam retyped to `ProcessAsync(validatedData, payload, ct) → List<ProcessItem>`, every L2 op and send wrapped in the Plan-01 `RetryLoop` (Retry:Limit), and the bus `UseMessageRetry` reconciled to the outer dead-letter latch — full hermetic suite 487 passed / 0 failed, `BaseProcessor.Core` Release 0-warning.
- Completes the v4.0.0 clean break (D-06/D-07): deletes the obsolete `ProcessResult.cs` (zero lingering references in `src/`/`tests/`), confirms `Processor.Sample` as the migrated worked example of the new `ProcessAsync → List<ProcessItem>` author contract (completed item with author-minted `ExecutionId` + a demonstrated `FailedException` status path now covered by a fact), and re-runs the phase-44 close gate — `SK_P.sln` Release 0-warning + the full hermetic suite 488 passed / 0 failed. Most of this plan's hands-on migration was already performed by the 44-02 executor's Rule-3 deviation; this plan landed the genuinely-remaining record deletion, reference hygiene, fail-path fact, and the green gate.
- Task 1 — Contracts (`cbbf904`):
- The Keeper proactive health engine: a swappable-TCS `IL2HealthGate` (starts CLOSED, cancel-aware wait), an edge-triggered `BitHealthLoop` BackgroundService that probes L2 each tick and Publishes `PauseAll`/`ResumeAll` once per transition, and a sentinel-parameterized `ProbeOnceAsync` extracted from `L2ProbeRecovery` — turning the Wave-0 Keeper RED stubs GREEN.
- The fleet-side enactment of the global broadcast: a thin scheduler-wide `PauseAllAsync` seam, a `PauseAllConsumer` (idempotent `PauseAll()`) + a `ResumeAllConsumer` (per-job resume over the L1 snapshot, NEVER native `ResumeAll()` — no catch-up herd), and both `ConsumerDefinition`s on a NEW per-replica fan-out endpoint `orchestrator-global-pauseresume` with single retry ownership — turning the Wave-0 Orchestrator RED stubs (incl. the load-bearing no-burst negative) GREEN.
- Relocated the shared RetryLoop into BaseConsole.Core, added Payload to KeeperReinject (contract + BuildReinject + golden test atomically), and scaffolded 11 RED Phase-46 test stubs so every Keeper/Orchestrator consumer in later waves has a discoverable automated target.
- Built the five sealed Keeper recovery-state consumers and their shared gate/retry base — the base awaits IL2HealthGate once at entry under a 300s-bounded linked CTS (throwing a transient marker on bound, Pattern A / D-03 LOCKED), and a Guard helper wraps every L2 op + Send in the relocated RetryLoop re-throwing on exhaustion (D-04). UPDATE writes the composite with the BackupOptions TTL; REINJECT re-injects an EntryStepDispatch carrying the D-01 Payload (or throws the data-gone terminal); INJECT does read→write(no TTL)→send→delete in strict order producing a StepCompleted indistinguishable from a direct completion; DELETE/CLEANUP delete the data/composite keys. Six Wave-0 Keeper-body facts are GREEN.
- Wired the five Keeper recovery consumers onto the shared queue:keeper-recovery endpoint with per-key ordering (KEEP-09): UpdateConsumerDefinition is the single endpoint-config owner — it registers UseMessageRetry plus five UsePartitioner<T> calls sharing one Partitioner(PartitionCount, Murmur3UnsafeHashGenerator) keyed on the IKeeperRecoverable 4-tuple (corr:wf:proc:exec, StepId excluded), while the other four definitions leave ConfigureConsumer an intentional no-op (Pitfalls 1 & 4). RecoveryOptions binds from the new "Recovery" appsettings section and all five consumers register additively alongside the surviving reactive FaultEntryStepDispatchConsumer. The partition-key fact and a data-gone dead-letter integration fact are GREEN.
- Replaced the single straight-through `ResultConsumer` with the `TypedResultConsumer<TMessage>` family — a generic advancement base (the verbatim `ResultConsumer.Consume` body with the hardcoded `StepOutcome.Completed` swapped for an abstract `Outcome` knob) plus four sealed one-line subclasses and four thin definitions on the shared `orchestrator-result` endpoint, with the ORCH-01 indistinguishability requirement proven green.
- Three hermetic Phase-47 facts proving the single-DLQ-consolidation (RESIL-02) and no-dedup (RESIL-03) structural invariants: a processor send-exhaustion -> skp-dlq-1 fact, a reflection no-MessageIdentity guard, and a directory-scoped no-keeper-dlq source-scan.
- Two duplicate-delivery no-collapse facts (StepCompleted via ONE RecordingDispatcher, KeeperReinject via ONE ReinjectConsumer + CapturingSendProvider) prove the v4 execution path reproduces effects on redelivery without dedup (RESIL-03), plus an additive Phase-47 trait makes the already-green data-gone proof (RESIL-02) discoverable for the audit.
- The phase's primary human-readable deliverable — `47-DLQ-AUDIT.md` mapping RESIL-02/RESIL-03 and roadmap SC-1/2/3 to 8 named GREEN proving tests — plus an additive A16 design-doc amendment elevating the at-least-once/no-dedup property to a test-cited guarantee and bundling the deferred Phase-46 KeeperReinject.Payload note. Doc-only: zero source change, build 0/0.
- Deleted the v3.x reactive Fault<T> Keeper recovery path (consumers, KeeperRecoveryHandler, the orphaned KeeperMetrics meter), reduced L2ProbeRecovery to the v4 BIT-probe helper, removed the keeper-dlq/keeper-fault-recovery queue consts + dead config/key remnants, and swept every dependent test — leaving the solution 0-warning green on the v4 recovery path alone.
- Authored the four-fact `ReactivePathRetiredFacts` class (anchored on the surviving `BitHealthLoop` assembly) that makes the RETIRE-03 teardown self-verifying and regression-proof, added the SC-2 RETIRE-02 remnant-verify (ExecutionData-Guid-only + no-Manifest), and widened the Phase-47 `keeper-dlq` scan to be unconditional now that `KeeperRecoveryHandler.cs` is deleted — Phase=48 trait run is 4/4 GREEN (non-empty) and the widened Phase-47 scan stays GREEN.
- Closed the v4.0.0 retirement story end-to-end: authored `48-TEARDOWN-AUDIT.md` (the RETIRE-01/02/03 + SC-1..SC-4 traceability ledger, every row citing a named green guard test/scan), flipped REQUIREMENTS.md RETIRE-01/02/03 to Satisfied, added the additive A17 design-doc amendment recording the reactive-path + keeper-dlq retirement, and passed the SC-4 hermetic close gate — the suite is GREEN ×3 consecutive (507/507, 0 failed) and both Release and Debug builds are 0-warning on the v4-only path.
- Authored SC1RoundTripE2ETests.cs — a Phase-49-tagged RealStack E2E that proves the full v4 Pre->In->Post round trip (dispatch consumed -> output written to skp:data:{entryId} -> orchestrator advances) with net-zero teardown; compiles 0-warning at Release+Debug and is excluded from the GREEN 507-fact hermetic suite.
- Authored `SC2RecoveryPathsE2ETests.cs` — a RealStack E2E that proves all four Keeper recovery states by direct-publishing the actual contracts to `queue:keeper-recovery` (const) and asserting each L2 / re-inject / orchestrator-advance / dead-letter effect, with every minted key (incl. the 2-day-TTL composite) registered to net-zero teardown.
- Authored SC3PauseResumeOutageE2ETests — a RealStack E2E (in its own non-parallel collection) proving the BIT-gate global pause-all/resume-all across a true transient L2 outage induced by `docker stop sk-redis` / `docker start sk-redis`, asserted via the orchestrator ES seam logs, healed in a finally; 0-warning Release+Debug, hermetic suite 507/507 GREEN.
- Authored `scripts/phase-49-close.ps1` (v4 triple-SHA N=3 GREEN net-zero close gate cloned from phase-39 with single `skp-dlq-1`, seed version `3.5.0`, no composite-TTL wait) and `49-HUMAN-UAT.md` (the operator runbook that gates the TEST-01/02/03 tick).
- Closed GAP-49-2: orchestrator Quartz scheduler no longer stays PAUSED for newly-scheduled workflows after a global pause-all/resume-all cycle — ResumeAllConsumer now clears Quartz's pausedTriggerGroups via a single scheduler-wide ResumeAll() placed AFTER the per-job fresh-from-now reschedule loop (no misfire herd).
- Chosen: shape (b) — publish-topology `BindQueue` + `DeployPublishTopology = true`.

A dedicated multi-replica `Keeper` console that makes the autonomous execution loop (cron fire → dispatch → process → result → fan-out) **self-heal through transient L2 (Redis) outages without operator intervention.** Keeper reacts to the `Fault<EntryStepDispatch>` / `Fault<ExecutionResult>` events the execution-path consumers publish on retry-budget exhaustion (pub/sub, bind-to-all — never per-`{procId}_error`), double-unwraps the inner message + 6-id correlation + `H`, runs a bounded crash-survivable L2 health-probe loop (read `skp:data:{entryId}` + write-then-delete a scratch key), pauses the affected workflow's cron via the single-replica orchestrator's Quartz scheduler (deterministic `TriggerKey` + `GetTriggerState` as the single source of truth — pause-state never in L2, because L2 is the resource being recovered), re-injects recovered work directly to its origin by type riding the receiver's surviving Phase-31 `flag[H]` idempotency (Keeper holds no dedup of its own), resumes on any successful recovery, and parks the genuinely unrecoverable in `keeper-dlq` for operator triage. A per-`H` attempt cap bounds the recover→reinject cycle so a persistent fault converges to a single park instead of flooding the stack. Transport-exhaustion across all consoles consolidates into one TTL'd `skp-dlq-1`, wired once in `BaseConsole.Core` (two DLQs, split by mechanism). Metrics gained a uniform `service_name = {name}_{version}` + non-empty `service_instance_id` across all four consoles (the processor's name/version DB-sourced via a MeterProvider swap), plus a full `Keeper` meter. Keeper is the automated operator for v3.6.0's accepted "an infra-faulting workflow keeps dead-lettering until an operator intervenes" gap.

The original 33-39 build was delivered + live-proven (Phase-39 close gate); a follow-up audit (2026-06-07) added three gap-closure phases — 40 (recovery hardening: attempt cap, deterministic drain, shared handler), 41 (pause/resume diagnostics: WR-01/WR-02), 42 (docs & traceability reconciliation).

### Key accomplishments

1. New multi-replica `Keeper` console on `BaseConsole.Core` (structural twin of `Orchestrator`, leaner) recovering L2-outage dead-letters off the `Fault<EntryStepDispatch>` / `Fault<ExecutionResult>` pub/sub stream — one durable competing-consumer queue, round-robin across replicas.
2. Bounded crash-survivable `L2ProbeRecovery` loop (read + write-then-delete scratch key, `catch RedisException` only, ack-after-loop) → re-inject the verbatim inner message to origin by type, riding the receiver's surviving Phase-31 `flag[H]` (Keeper carries no dedup of its own).
3. Two-DLQ topology split by mechanism — consolidated `skp-dlq-1` (Immediate(N) transport exhaustion across all consoles, 7d TTL, wired once in `BaseConsole.Core` keeping `GenerateFaultFilter`) + `keeper-dlq` (probe/cap give-up park, depth = primary Prometheus alert).
4. Orchestrator pause/resume coordination via a deterministic Quartz `TriggerKey` three-state model (`PauseJob`/`GetTriggerState` as the single source of truth, no L1 state field), `ConcurrentMessageLimit=1` idempotent consumers; Keeper Publishes Pause-at-intake + Resume-on-Recovered.
5. Recovery hardening (Phase 40) — per-`H` attempt cap (atomic INCR+PEXPIRE-NX Lua, parks `recover_cap` instead of flooding) + deterministic keeper-dlq drain + one shared `KeeperRecoveryHandler` both consumers delegate to.
6. Uniform metric labels (Phase 38) — `service_name = {name}_{version}` + non-empty `service_instance_id` across all four consoles (processor DB-sourced via MeterProviderHolder swap; logs `service.name` kept bare) + a full `Keeper` meter (6 counters + UpDownCounter + histogram), live-proven by Prometheus scrape.

### Known deferred items at close

No functional blockers (audit `tech_debt`). 23 open artifacts acknowledged and deferred (recorded in STATE.md Deferred Items): per-phase live HUMAN-UAT smokes (33/34/35/36/37/40) and `human_needed` VERIFICATION statuses — **by design** consolidated into the single authoritative Phase-39 real-stack close gate (passed: 3×500 GREEN, triple-SHA net-zero), not re-run per phase; plus stale older items (Ph 08/09 v3.2.0, 32/32.1 v3.6.0) and a leftover Phase-29 debug session. KHARD-02's live 3× close-gate is Manual-Only (drain fix source-resolved; live re-run operator-pending). Nyquist VALIDATION partial/missing on 8 phases (advisory). FUTURE-KEEPER-SWEEP (auto-resume into recovered L2) deferred to a future milestone. **v3.5.0 formal ROADMAP/MILESTONES/tag archival remains deferred** (prior-milestone housekeeping; snapshot at `milestones/v3.5.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`).

## v3.6.0 — Idempotent Execution (Exactly-Once-Effect Round-Trip)

**Shipped:** 2026-06-05
**Tag:** `v3.6.0`
**Archives:** [milestones/v3.6.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v3.6.0-ROADMAP.md) · [milestones/v3.6.0-REQUIREMENTS.md](milestones/v3.6.0-REQUIREMENTS.md) · [milestones/v3.6.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md](milestones/v3.6.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md)

### Delivered

The orchestrator↔processor execution round-trip became **exactly-once-effect**. Every duplicate inbound message — from configurable `Immediate(N)` retry, broker redelivery, publish-confirm ambiguity, the orchestrator's own re-dispatch, or a fan-in/merge re-dispatch — reproduces the same deterministic identity `H = SHA-256(correlationId, workflowId, stepId, processorId, EntryId)` (executionId excluded) and is collapsed at the receiving node via an **effect-first** `flag[H]` `Pending → Ack` CAS at both hops, so each step's downstream effect happens exactly once with no lost branch and `ProcessAsync` needs no idempotency logic. L2 data is content-addressed at two levels (result blobs + manifest); merge steps are per-edge (distinguished by input `EntryId`, identical-input collapses), and the orchestrator fans the manifest out N×M. The hard-coded `Immediate(3)` became a configurable retry budget; content-addressed `data`/`flag` keys are `prefix + 64-hex`. A late course-correction (Phase 32 → 32.1) **reverted** the planned cancelled circuit-breaker — after building it, the two-level breaker was judged not worth its surface area and net-deleted in favor of plain dead-lettering to `_error` on exhaustion; the Phase-31 idempotency gates survived the revert intact.

### Key accomplishments

1. Deterministic message identity `H` via a single canonical `MessageIdentity` hash class (executionId excluded) — a retry/redelivery/re-dispatch of the same logical message yields the same `H`.
2. Effect-first `flag[H]` CAS dedup at BOTH hops (processor inbound dispatch + orchestrator inbound result) — exactly-once-EFFECT with a collapsed-duplicate residual, never a lost branch.
3. Content-addressed two-level L2 data (result blobs at `data[hash(blob)]` + manifest at `data[hash(manifest)]`) with N×M orchestrator manifest fan-out; empty result = terminal branch.
4. Per-edge merge correctness — content-collapse on identical input, distinct `H` (no override) on divergent input; the `StepB4`-×2 duplicate proven gone live in Elasticsearch.
5. Configurable retry budget (`Immediate(N)` default) bound from appsettings at all 4 endpoints, replacing the hard-coded `Immediate(3)`.
6. Cancelled circuit-breaker built then **consciously reverted** (Phase 32 → 32.1) to plain dead-lettering on exhaustion — a net-deletion that preserved the Phase-31 idempotency layer (integration re-confirmed 5/5).

### Known deferred items at close

Artifact/doc hygiene only (no functional blockers): Phase 32's VERIFICATION/VALIDATION still read pending against the reverted breaker (moot — superseded); Phase 31.1 has no VERIFICATION/VALIDATION/SECURITY (gap-closure, script-only); Phase 32.1 VALIDATION `nyquist_compliant: false` by design (real-stack behaviors are manual-only operator-gate, live-proven by the close gate + smoke tests). Accepted runtime consequence: a persistently infra-faulting workflow is not auto-stopped — each cron fire dead-letters one message to `_error` until an operator intervenes. v3.5.0's formal archival (ROADMAP/MILESTONES/tag) remains deferred.

## v3.4.0 — BaseConsole + Orchestrator Messaging

**Shipped:** 2026-06-01
**Tag:** `v3.4.0`

### Delivered

A reusable `BaseConsole.Core` Generic-Host library (the console-side mirror of `BaseApi.Core`) and a runnable `Orchestrator` console that inherits it, connected to the WebApi over MassTransit/RabbitMQ. Body-carried CorrelationId is proven end-to-end (HTTP `X-Correlation-Id` → publish-boundary `NewId` mint → fan-out message body → orchestrator log scope, surfaced in Elasticsearch). The full orchestrator lifecycle landed: startup L1 hydration from the `skp:` parent-index, per-workflow Quartz scheduling, entry-step dispatch to `queue:{processorId}`, and stop teardown. The processor→orchestrator result round-trip closes the loop — `ExecutionResult`/`StepOutcome` consumed on a shared competing-consumer queue, L1-only edge traversal + continuation dispatch. A late gating redesign (Phase 24.1, gap-closure) replaced the boot gate + scheduled redelivery + the `rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange` plugin with an L2-existence dedup + atomic discover-then-delete Stop + L1-only graceful result path, and added a terminal-step guard.

### Key accomplishments

1. `Messaging.Contracts` leaf assembly — frozen `ICorrelated` vocabulary + shared `L2ProjectionKeys` single-source-of-truth (writer↔reader desync structurally impossible).
2. `BaseConsole.Core` reusable Generic-Host library — metrics-only OTel (no traces), soft-dep Redis, embedded minimal-Kestrel health probes, MassTransit bus + correlation filters.
3. Two-process WebApi↔Orchestrator messaging over RabbitMQ with body-carried CorrelationId proven end-to-end in Elasticsearch.
4. L2 root-parent restructure + processor self-registration boundary + liveness-gated Start (422 + RFC 7807).
5. Full orchestrator lifecycle — L1 hydration, Quartz scheduling, entry-step dispatch, stop teardown (no L2 mutation by the orchestrator).
6. Processor→orchestrator result round-trip + L1-only step advancement, then a gating redesign (Phase 24.1) removing the boot gate/redelivery/plugin in favor of L2-existence dedup + atomic Stop + L1-only graceful result.

### Known deferred items at close

Two non-blocking dead-code cleanups (recorded in the audit for a future hygiene pass): `RedisProjectionOptions.ProcessorKeyTtlDays` (dead config field post-Phase-22) and `WorkflowRootNotFoundException` (never thrown post-24.1; harmless `Ignore<>` no-ops). Nyquist VALIDATION.md missing for Phases 21 and 24.1 (discovery-only flag).

### Delivered

The orchestration Start/Stop build pipeline: `POST /api/v1/orchestration/start` fetches each requested workflow graph from Postgres (L3), builds a transient in-memory `WorkflowGraphSnapshot` (L1), validates it (existence → cycle → schema-edge → payload-config-schema, 422 + RFC 7807 at first failed gate), and projects it into 3 Redis (L2) keyspaces that external consumers read. Stop is a Redis existence gate with GET-and-follow cleanup. Redis landed as a soft compose-stack dependency (Phase 5 HEALTH contracts untouched). Closes v2-deferred VALID-21 at orchestration-start scope. No new SQL entities or columns — L3 schema is the v3.2.0 `InitialCreate` unchanged.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Redis as a soft infrastructure tier** — `redis:7.4.x-alpine` in compose (RSALv2/SSPLv1, not AGPLv3 8.0+); `AddBaseApiRedis` registers `IConnectionMultiplexer` Singleton + `RedisProjectionOptions`; `/health/ready` stays 200 with Redis down (only Start/Stop fail with 500 + RFC 7807); `RedisFixture` per-class `KeyPrefix` isolation with SCAN-assert-zero teardown (FLUSHDB forbidden).
2. **OrchestrationService split + transient L1 build** — thin orchestrator delegating to `IWorkflowGraphLoader` + 3 validators + `IRedisProjectionWriter`; `WorkflowGraphSnapshot` (flat `Dictionary<Guid, EntityDto>` per entity) loaded via batch `AsNoTracking` reads, disposed via `using` on success and failure paths; multi-child fan-out traversal.
3. **Validation gates in mandatory order (closes VALID-21)** — existence → cycle (ITERATIVE DFS, no recursion) → schema-edge (strict `Guid` equality) → Payload↔ConfigSchema (JsonSchema.Net draft 2020-12, SSRF-locked, per-Start parse cache); single `OrchestrationValidationException` → 422 with offending entity ids at the first failed gate; L1 cleanup in `finally`.
4. **L2 Redis materialized projection + Stop** — 3 keyspaces (root/step/processor) written in one `CreateBatch()` pipeline via System.Text.Json (camelCase-pinned records, processor-only TTL, `TimeProvider` liveness); Stop is a collect-all-missing existence gate (422 with full missing list, no deletion) else GET-and-follow cleanup (deletes root + per-step, never processor keys — `IServer.Keys()`/`KEYS` forbidden) → 204; non-idempotent by design.
5. **Idempotency + concurrency + 3-GREEN closeout** — re-Start reflects the second write (jobId changed) with orphan GC; concurrent Starts both 204 (last-write-wins, no Redis lock); gate failures write zero L2 keys (SCAN-verified); close gate ran 3× consecutive GREEN at 235 passed with byte-identical `psql \l` + `redis-cli --scan` SHA-256 BEFORE=AFTER.

### Decisions Set in Stone (v3.3.0)

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Redis is a SOFT dependency (`/health/ready` never probes it; CRUD serves 200 down) | ✓ Good  |
| Iterative DFS for cycle detection (no recursion — `StackOverflowException` uncatchable) | ✓ Good  |
| Strict `Schema.Id` equality for schema-edge compatibility (null-side passes)       | ✓ Good  |
| System.Text.Json (not Mapperly) for L2 DTO → JSON serialization                    | ✓ Good  |
| `IServer.Keys()`/`KEYS` forbidden in production; targeted GET-and-follow traversal | ✓ Good  |
| Stop scope: existence-gate + root/step deletion (never processor keys), non-idempotent | ✓ Good  |
| Per-processor keys TTL'd (`ProcessorKeyTtlDays` default 100); root/step no TTL     | ✓ Good  |

### Closed Requirements (per phase)

- **Phase 12 (Redis infra + composition + healthcheck + DI)** — INFRA-REDIS-01..06, INFRA-COMP-01..04, TEST-REDIS-01..05
- **Phase 13 (OrchestrationService split + L3 fetch + L1 build)** — ORCH-SPLIT-01..04, L1-BUILD-01..05
- **Phase 14 (Validation gates)** — L1-VALIDATE-01..10 (closes deferred VALID-21 at orchestration-start scope)
- **Phase 15 (L2 Redis projection write + Stop existence check)** — L2-PROJECT-01..07, ORCH-START-01..08, ORCH-STOP-01..07, OBSERV-REDIS-01..03
- **Phase 16 (Idempotency + concurrency + L1 cleanup + 3-GREEN closeout)** — TEST-REDIS-06..09

**Total: 64/64 requirements satisfied** (milestone audit PASSED — integration fully wired, all E2E flows complete).

### Notes

- **OBSERV-REDIS-04 deferred** — Redis-side profiling metrics → Prometheus; future milestone (FUTURE-OTEL-REDIS).
- **Deferred future candidates** — FUTURE-STOP-EVICTION (full eviction + processor-key ref-counting), FUTURE-SCHEDULER (real JobId/Liveness writers), FUTURE-GENERATION-ID (stale-projection detection), FUTURE-VALID-21-HTTP-WRITE (VALID-21 at Assignment write time).
- **Stop scope evolved twice** — original mirror-of-Start eviction → existence-check-only (2026-05-28) → root+step deletion (never processor keys) + collect-all-missing gate (Phase 15 D-04/D-06).
- **Known deferred items at close** — Nyquist VALIDATION.md for phases 12/14/16 left in `draft` (all passed VERIFICATION + 3×235 GREEN close gate); close-gate script maintenance smells (`-1` fact-count fallback, compose `ps --format json` assumption, PS1/SH divergence). Both tech-debt only, do not affect correctness. Phase 15 `15-HUMAN-UAT.md` (status passed, 0 pending) flagged by audit-open as a benign false positive — acknowledged at close.

### Code Review / Verification Posture at Close

All 5 phases passed independent VERIFICATION (12: 5/5, 13: 9/9, 14: 5/5 verified, 15: 5/5 human-verified, 16: 12/12). Cross-phase integration checker confirmed all 5 seams wired with no gaps and all E2E flows complete. Phase 16 close gate: 3×235 GREEN, dual-SHA BEFORE=AFTER held, EF-migration + HEALTH-01..05 byte-immutable guards clean.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Reusable `BaseApi.Core` composition root** — `AddBaseApi`/`UseBaseApi` wires generic `BaseController` / `BaseService` / `Repository<T>` through abstract DTO / Validator / Mapper seams; `Program.cs` capped at ≤10 non-trivial body lines; observability split to `IHostApplicationBuilder.AddBaseApiObservability` for MEL bridge.
2. **5 v1 entity feature folders + 3 junction tables + InitialCreate migration + multistage Dockerfile** — Schema / Processor / Step / Assignment / Workflow CRUD over real Postgres 17 with audit-symmetric Mapperly mappings, FluentValidation per-entity rules, and explicit FK constraint names matching the Phase 4 `PostgresExceptionMapper` regex.
3. **Cross-cutting middleware + RFC 7807 Problem Details** — `X-Correlation-Id` middleware (read-or-generate, echoed on every response), 4-handler `IExceptionHandler` chain (NotFound → Validation → DbUpdate → Fallback), Postgres SQLSTATE → HTTP mapping (`23503`→422, `23505`→409, both with offending field name).
4. **OpenTelemetry backend cutover (Phase 11)** — logs ship to Elasticsearch (`logs-generic.otel-default`, OTLP-normalized field shape), metrics ship to Prometheus (`up{job="otel-collector"}=1`, `service_name="sk-api"` label preserved via `resource_to_telemetry_conversion`), traces dropped; Collector v0.152.0 wired in compose stack alongside ES 8.15.5 + Prom v3.11.3; Phase 5 file-exporter test infrastructure fully retired.
5. **Three K8s-style health probes with strict tag discipline** — `/health/live` (process only, never DB per Pitfall 15), `/health/ready` (Postgres + StartupCompletionService), `/health/startup` (migration-gated via `MigrateAsync` in `StartupCompletionService.ExecuteAsync` try/catch/LogCritical/no-rethrow contract).
6. **Test suite discipline** — 142/142 integration facts × 3 consecutive GREEN runs (163s / 161s / 162s on final Phase 11 close), zero flakes; byte-identical `psql \l` SHA-256 snapshot `0d98b0de…0aac127` BEFORE = AFTER (4 baseline DBs, zero leaked `stepsdb_test_*` databases — Phase 3 D-15 invariant preserved across all 11 phases).

### Decisions Set in Stone (v3.2.0)

| Decision                                                                  | Outcome  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Single-API (Option B) instead of 6 separate webapis                       | ✓ Good   |
| `BaseApi.Core` shared class library + abstract generic controllers        | ✓ Good   |
| `BaseEntity` abstract, no table; 5 concrete entities → 5 tables           | ✓ Good   |
| Single Postgres DB + single `AppDbContext`                                | ✓ Good   |
| Mapperly source-generators (RMG007/RMG012/RMG020/RMG089 → solution error) | ✓ Good   |
| FluentValidation with inheritable `BaseDtoValidator<T>`                   | ✓ Good   |
| OTel Collector via OTLP — logs to ES, metrics to Prom, no traces          | ✓ Good   |
| `MigrateAsync` at startup inside `StartupCompletionService` (PERSIST-10)  | ✓ Good   |
| `Processor.ConfigSchemaId` (Phase 10) — symmetric Input/Output/Config FKs | ✓ Good   |
| `Assignment` surface collapsed to `(StepId, Payload)` only (Phase 10)     | ✓ Good   |

### Closed Requirements (per phase)

- **Phase 1 (Repository Scaffold)** — INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04
- **Phase 2 (Postgres + Docker Compose)** — INFRA-06, INFRA-07
- **Phase 3 (EF Core Persistence Base)** — ENTITY-01, ENTITY-02, PERSIST-02..07, PERSIST-11, PERSIST-15, PERSIST-16
- **Phase 4 (Cross-Cutting Middleware + Error Handling)** — OBSERV-09..11, ERROR-01..11
- **Phase 5 (Observability + Health Probes)** — OBSERV-01..08, OBSERV-12 (later superseded by Phase 11 D-03), HEALTH-01..05
- **Phase 6 (Validation + Mapping Base)** — VALID-01..07, HTTP-10
- **Phase 7 (Generic HTTP Base + Composition Root)** — HTTP-01..03, HTTP-08, HTTP-09, HTTP-13..16
- **Phase 8 (Entity Build-Out + Migrations + Docker + Tests)** — 41 REQ-IDs: PERSIST-01/08/09/10/12/13/14, ENTITY-03..10, HTTP-04..07/11/12, VALID-08..20, INFRA-05, TEST-01/02/05/06
- **Phase 9 (Processor.GetBySourceHash + Orchestration Start/Stop)** — 6 SPEC-local REQ-IDs (REQ-1..REQ-6)
- **Phase 10 (Remove SchemaId on Assignment; add ConfigSchemaId on Processor)** — ENTITY-04, ENTITY-07, VALID-11, VALID-15 amended
- **Phase 11 (Migrate Prometheus + Elasticsearch into compose stack)** — OBSERV-13, OBSERV-14, INFRA-08, TEST-07; OBSERV-12 supersession finalized; INFRA-06 amendment locked

### Notes

- **TEST-03 / TEST-04 deferred to v2** (Phase 8 D-05/D-06) — concurrency & xmin token integration tests deferred; current unit-level coverage (Phase 3 `XminConcurrencyTokenTests`) judged sufficient for v1 ship.
- **`WorkflowScheduleEntity` dropped** — replaced by `Workflow.CronExpression` nullability for gating.
- **Authentication/Authorization out of scope for v1** — service is open; `CreatedBy`/`UpdatedBy` populate only when `HttpContext.User.Identity.Name` is available.
- **`(Name, Version)` is not unique** — user-specified; `Version` is metadata.

### Code Review Posture at Close

Across Phase 11 close: 0 critical / 5 warning / 8 info — all warnings test-hygiene only (cancellation token threading, env var restoration, TOCTOU windows). None blocked phase completion. Aggregated across all 11 phases: 0 critical findings reached production paths; all warnings advisory or test-hygiene.
